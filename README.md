# QCustomPlot Based Qt Application with Enhanced Features
**This project is a Qt application that utilizes the QCustomPlot library for creating interactive data visualizations.** 
**It focuses on clean code and efficient GUI development using Qt's runtime features.** 
**This project is ideal for developers interested in exploring and learning how to create data visualizations with Qt and QCustomPlot.**

## **Features:**

* **Data Generation and Plotting:**
    * Generate random data for visualization
    * Plot various data types (e.g., line, scatter)
* **Axis Control:**
    * Change Y-axis placement for better data representation
    * Auto-scaling and custom scaling of X and Y axes
    * Set custom tick positions on the X-axis
* **Zoom and Pan:**
    * Zoom in/out on specific areas of the plot
    * Reset zoom to view all data points
* **Area Selection (WIP):**
    * Select a specific area of the plot for detailed analysis
* **Other Features:**
    * Reverse X-axis for specific data visualization needs
    * Capture the plot as an image for documentation or sharing
* **Selecting points by clicking on them::**
    * Improved point selection accuracy through modified event handling.
	
**Note:** This project relies on a custom QCustomPlot build. Compatibility with standard QCustomPlot versions is not guaranteed.
